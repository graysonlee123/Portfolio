summary: "Articulate is a website where users can load, save, and comment on web development articles from Smashing Magazine."
intro: "The goal of this project is to provide a place to discuss articles from Smashing Magazine, while crediting the website and the authors. It also provides experience with interacting with MongoDB on the front-end, as well as exercising best database structure practices."

## The idea

After making a request from the server to Smashing Magazine, I get back the contents of the requested page, in HTML. Then I parse out the data from the page that I need and store it in a database. Lastly, I can display all of the archived content to the users that come to visit Articulate.

## Tech stack 

There needed to be three core functionalities to make this project work. A database, an HTML parser, and a HTTP request library. For this, I selected MongoDB, Cheerio, and Axios, respectively.

The tech stack works very well with one another. Additionally, I avoided using a front-end framework, which saved development time and lowered the risk of over-complicating a simple project. Sometimes, it's nice to work in plain HTML and CSS when that's all you need.

## Lessons learned

One of the trickiest parts about the project was figuring out how to structure and store all of the data. I decided to strip all of the HTML from the teaser of the article and save it as a simple string. I could have saved it as encoded HTML entities, but I actually ended up preferring the look of the plain teaser. Additionally, it's more future-proof in case one article has something unexpected or complicated in the teaser.

export default function ({ children }) {
  const image = {
    src: heroImage,
    alt: 'A screenshot of Articulate',
  }

  return <ProjectLayout data={{ frontmatter, image }}>{children}</ProjectLayout>
}
